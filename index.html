    <h1>A little info about mojang:</h1>
    <p>
      Mojang Studios was founded by Markus Persson, a Swedish independent video
      game designer and programmer, in 2009. He had gained interest in video
      games at an early age, playing The Bard's Tale and several pirated games
      on his father's Commodore 128 home computer, and learned to programme at
      age eight with help from his sister. Because he was a "loner" in school,
      he spent most of his spare time with games and programming at home.
      Following his graduation and a few years of working as a web developer,
      Persson created Wurm Online, a massively multiplayer online role-playing
      game, with colleague Rolf Jansson in 2003. They used the name "Mojang
      Specifications" during the development and, as the game started turning a
      profit, incorporated the company Mojang Specifications AB (an aktiebolag)
      in 2007. Persson left the project later that year and wished to reuse the
      name, wherefore Jansson renamed the company Onetoofree AB and later Code
      Club AB. Meanwhile, Persson had joined Midas, later known as King.com,
      where he developed 25â€“30 games. He departed the company when he was barred
      from creating games in his free time.
